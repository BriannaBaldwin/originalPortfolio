    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I was born in Anchorage, AK and moved to Eagle, ID when I was 14 years old. I currently work for Shine Bright Maids as a Lead.</p>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>For my first year of college I was a Pre-Nursing major, but I wasn't a fan of Anatomy or Physiology. 
    I started looking into other career fields and only heard good things about coding and the IT industry, so I gave it a try and now I'm a Software Development major at College of Western Idaho and loving it!
    I find myself getting excited to learn more and researching what career fields are best for me based off what languages I'm enjoying the most.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I enjoy a variety of different activities including shopping, binge-watching shows and taking walks around the block.
    However, I tend to not have time for all my hobbies because I spend most of my time focusing on school and work.
    My favorite activity is learning new things and I'm constantly looking for miscellaneous classes to take, so I can practice new skills.</p>
